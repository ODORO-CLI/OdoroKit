 * Fades the whole WebGL canvas out — but only once the reader is leaving the
 * Impact slide for the footer, **not** as Impact arrives.
 *
 * The starfield is the shared backdrop the logo mark assembles over, so it has to
 * persist through Impact: fading it there is exactly what made the transition
 * read as a hard cut between two separate scenes. The maelstrom itself leaves the
 * frame on its own — the camera dives through it — so only the footer needs the
 * canvas gone, and it holds the starry background the whole way through the logo
 * build.
 *
 * Driven by **scroll position** past the Impact slide's top (monotonic, reverses
 * cleanly), read on the shared ticker so the fade costs no re-renders.
