/**
 * Uniform-scale layout for the getLayers hero (Figma 665:1694).
 *
 * The redesign is a single fixed 1440×800 composition that must keep its exact
 * internal proportions at every viewport — the brief was "scale the layout,
 * preserving the mockup's composition". So rather than reflow, the hero renders
 * its children at their literal design pixels and scales the whole frame by one
 * factor: `min(vw/1440, vh/800)` (a `contain` fit — the frame never overflows
 * the viewport, and its 1.8 aspect is preserved with the live vortex filling any
 * letterbox behind it).
 *
 * `navTop` pins the fixed nav to the *top of the viewport* with a constant inset,
 * the mockup's 10px nav gap scaled by the frame factor — not to the centred
 * frame's top edge. Centring on the frame let a tall viewport's top letterbox
 * push the nav down (its offset grew with the screen height); pinning to the
 * viewport keeps the same gap at every height, which is what the bar wants as a
 * `position: fixed` element.
 *
 * SSR / first paint returns a stable `scale: 1` so server and client markup
 * match; the real measurement lands in a mount effect, one frame later.

 * - `width`: `vw/1440` — the frame always spans the full viewport width, so a

 *   to the mockup on every screen. Trades a small vertical clip on ultrawide.
