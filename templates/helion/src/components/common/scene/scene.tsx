 * ticker, so it shares one `requestAnimationFrame` with every spring on the
 * page. It reads scroll progress from `@/lib/scene/scroll-state`, written each
 * frame by `SectionController`.
 *
 * `h-lvh`/`w-lvw`: iOS Safari's address bar changes the dynamic viewport, so
 * the canvas is sized against the *largest* viewport and always fills the
 * screen. `transform-gpu` + `backface-hidden` promote the wrapper to its own
 * compositor layer — without it, a neighbouring fixed element repainting during
 * scroll invalidates the WebGL composite on WebKit and the whole scene flickers.
